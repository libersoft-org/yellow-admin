# Bugs

- Domains - domains-list.svelte when I set the domainID (for example by clicking on delete button, and then on Add a new domain - the label is still "Edit the domain" instead of "Add a new domain")
- Domains - fix lazy loader - it doesn't load more records when no need for scrolling
- When session is expired, it doesn't show any error

# Features

- Domains - edit
- Admins - list, add, edit, delete
- Sessions - list, add, delete
- Users - list, add, edit, delete
- Remove autologin in login.svelte -> onMount;
- Fix files rights
